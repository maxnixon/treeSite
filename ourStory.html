      <h1 class="about">Meet Joeseph Kemerle/Valentine ~ Founder/Owner Atreeum Tree Service "The Sky Is The Limit</h1>

        <p>In 2015 Joseph  started as an apprentice at a Mom&Pops Tree Co. Sixteen months later Joe's girlfriend at the time gave birth to his daughter "Autumn Skyar" (Hence the company name Atreeum) He was at the time livng in Virginia and had made his way up the food chain top become a tree Climber - the most difficult position in the field. Not much long later Joseph experienced some hardships and had to move back to NJ with nothing but his vehicle, climbing gear, and his chain saw. Before "Atreeum Tree Service" became an official company Joesph started soliciting to use the skills he knew to provide for his daughter. However within the next few months, his calender was filled beyond the the amount of time there is in a week. So Joe called a fe reliable friends... told them they now had a job... and the rest is history! </p>
